# VoID - Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets

[VoID](http://www.w3.org/TR/void/) is an RDF Schema vocabulary for expressing metadata about RDF datasets.

VoID has been published as a W3C Note through the Semantic Web Interest Group (SWIG) in March 2011. This repository supports the maintenance of VoID beyond W3C. It replaces the [`void-impl`](https://code.google.com/p/void-impl/) Google Code project.

## Issue Tracker

The issue tracker is used to track reported errors and requests for enhancements.

## Spec/Guide

Various versions of the document are kept here. TODO: Clean up.

## RDFS

The RDFS representation of VoID is maintained in a Neologism instance at [http://vocab.deri.ie/void](http://vocab.deri.ie/void). As none of the VoID authors are still employed at DERI, the long-term stability of this location cannot be guaranteed. We keep a copy of the latest version of the RDFS file here.
