The "Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets" (voiD) is an RDF-Schema vocabulary for expressing metadata about RDF datasets. 
With voiD, the discovery and usage of Linked Datasets can be performed both effectively and efficiently. A dataset is a collection of data, published and maintained by a single provider, available as RDF, and accessible, for example, through dereferenceable HTTP URIs or a SPARQL endpoint. 

The development of voiD started in mid 2008, with a first version of the vocabulary and guide published in 01/2009 [1]. Since then, voiD has enjoyed considerable uptake in the Linked Data community and beyond, with usage throughout from data.gov.uk to individual datasets [2]. 

A number of voiD-based implementations is available via [3]. The development of the core voiD vocabulary and the guide is an open process with a dedicated mailing list [4] and issue tracker [5].

W3C-wise, voiD is relevant for the work in the SPARQL WG [6] as well as the upcoming eGov WG [7].

We hereby submit the ED 'Describing Linked Datasets with the voiD Vocabulary' [8] to W3C's Semantic Web Interest Group (SWIG) with the goal to publish it as a W3C Interest Group Note. We appreciate feedback on this ED till 31 Jan 2011 via the 'semantic-web@w3.org' mailing list.

Cheers,
