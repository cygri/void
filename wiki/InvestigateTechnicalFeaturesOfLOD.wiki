#summary Our survey of the type of technical features of current LoD.

Based on Issue 39: http://code.google.com/p/void-impl/issues/detail?id=39

The goal of this survey is to understand how void:feature is being used by early adopters and estimate potential impact for proposing alternative patterns in voiD 2.0.

== Query to the Keith's Talis Store ==

 * http://tinyurl.com/y94q264 is a query for  features used in existing void descriptions - there aren't many (K.J.W.Alexander). The result shows the following URIs used in voiD descriptions:
  # RDF/JSON serialisation:(http://api.talis.com/stores/kwijibo-dev3/items/features/RDF_JSON)
  # Turtle RDF serialisation: (http://api.talis.com/stores/kwijibo-dev3/items/features/Turtle_RDF)
  # RDF/XML (http://neuroweb.med.yale.edu/senselab/senselab-void.ttlRDFXML)
  # RDF/XML serialisation (http://api.talis.com/stores/kwijibo-dev3/items/features/rdfxml)
  # Turtle (http://telegraphis.net/data/void#Turtle)
  # HTTP Content Negotiation (http://api.talis.com/stores/kwijibo-dev3/items/features/Content_Negotiation)
  # RDF/XML (http://telegraphis.net/data/void#RDFXML)
  # N-Triples RDF Serialisation (http://api.talis.com/stores/kwijibo-dev3/items/features/N-Triples)
  # N3 (http://telegraphis.net/data/void#N3)

== Terms used in the ESW wiki ==
The following terms are used by people to describe their RDF data dump, as summarized at http://esw.w3.org/topic/DataSetRDFDumps:
 * tab-delimited file
 * RDF/XML
 * N3
 * tab-separated values
 * OWL
 
A lot of RDF dumps are made available as a zip file, making the actual technical features of these data invisible. (maybe zip/tar is also a technical feature ?)


== Search in Sindice ==
Only one instance was returned, whose features are defined in a locate domain:
 * http://telegraphis.net/data/void#Turtle
 * http://telegraphis.net/data/void#RDFXML

== Search in voiD/RKB ==
No sign of void:feature or dcterms:format.

== Search in Openlink voiD Store ==
