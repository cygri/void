#summary Collection of SPARQL queries for computing voiD statistics

= Introduction =

This page collects SPARQL queries for computing various statistics that can be computed in voiD.

= Expressible statistics =

Here are some candidates that we would like to express in SPARQL. Note, the assumption is that it's going to be SPARQL 1.1.

  * total number of triples
  * total number of distinct URIs
  * total number of distinct subject nodes
  * total number of distinct object nodes
  * exhaustive list of classes used in the dataset
  * exhaustive list of properties used in the dataset
  * table: class vs. total number of instances of the class
  * table: property vs. total number of triples using the property
  * table: property vs. total number of distinct subjects in triples using the prop
  * table: property vs. total number of distinct objects in triples using the prop
  * list of all domain names occurring in URIs in subjects or objects
  * table: domain names vs. number of triples where the domain name occurs in subject or object
